3. One-off tasks
   * Choose & update the LICENSE, [here](LICENSE)
   * Update _Maven Publication_ details [here](%ARTIFACT_NAME%/build.gradle.kts#L6-L13)
   * [Configure GitHub Pages](#prerequisites-configure-github-pages) to deploy branch 'gh-pages' (Javadoc)
   * Add secrets required for [publishing to Maven Central](#prerequisites-sonatype-credentials--gpg-signing-key)
   * Create and provide a PAT required for [release pipeline](#prerequisites-pat-provided-as-cigithubtoken)
   * Install & configure renovate app ([instructions](#prerequisites-enable--configure-renovate))

## Project Structure
The project template consists of three top level folders
* `.github/`: Defines the Github Actions CI tasks and templates for new pull requests, issues, etc.
* `gradle/`: Contains Gradle Configuration files such as the Gradle [Version Catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html) and the Gradle Wrapper.
* `%ARTIFACT_NAME%/`: The library source code (gradle sub-project).

In addition, following files are worth highlighting:
* `gradle/libs.versions.toml`: A [conventional file](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:conventional-dependencies-toml) to declare a version catalog.
* `settings.gradle.kts`: The multi-project Gradle settings file. Here are all sub-projects defined.
* `gradle.properties`: Holds the library version, needed & maintained by the CI/CD pipeline [release process](#release-process).
* `**/build.gradle.kts`: Gradle build file

## CI/CD Pipeline
The heart of this template is the 'Main GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline'.

![image](https://github.com/thriving-dev/java-library-template/assets/10864443/8e5436c3-f807-4617-9e77-6d21e9dfb7c2)

The workflow encompasses multiple jobs, modelled and linked with dependencies and conditions.
Based on the context (trigger, ref, input arguments) it meets different use cases:
1. **Check**. Build, test, integration test; code quality & vulnerability scans.    
   Runs for active PRs - as well as part of all subsequent listed use cases.
2. **Latest**. 'Check', publish SNAPSHOT version to Maven Central and Javadoc (GitHub Pages).   
   Runs on pushes to the main branch.
3. **Release Process**. 'Check', executes (major|minor|patch) release process via Gradle plugin.   
   Manually triggered workflow via GitHub UI/API.
3. **Library Release**. 'Check', publish RELEASE version to Maven Central and Javadoc (GitHub Pages).   
   Runs for pushed tags.

## Publish to Maven Central
### Automated Process
The maven publish process is fully automated and does not require manual action.
- The _main_ branch (per process definition) always is set to the next [SNAPSHOT version](gradle.properties) and is published to the Sonatype snapshot repository with each main CI/CD pipeline run. The pipeline runs e.g. when a PR is merged, but can also be triggered manually.
- Release deployment happens when a new tag is pushed to GitHub. (Part of the [release process](#release-process))

### Prerequisites: Sonatype Credentials & GPG Signing Key
The initial setup for your OSSRH repository requires some manual steps and human review (see why), after which your deployment process is typically modified to get components into OSSRH. These are all one time steps.
I recommend to follow the [official guide](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-guide/).

In order to deploy your components to OSSRH with Gradle, you have to meet the [requirements](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/) for your metadata in the pom.xml as well as supply the required, signed components.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The publish process uses [io.github.gradle-nexus.publish-plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.github.gradle-nexus.publish-plugin) under the hood.

The gradle project as well as the CI/CD pipeline is already fully prepared for the publish process.
The GH actions job [callable.publish-sonatype.yml](.github/workflows/callable.publish-sonatype.yml) requires following Secrets:

| Secret name              | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `OSSRH_USERNAME`         | The username of your OSSRH account.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `OSSRH_PASSWORD`         | The password of your OSSRH account.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `GPG_SIGNING_KEY`        | The GPG private key to sign your artifacts (in ascii-armored format). You can obtain it with `gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <your@email.here>` or you can create one key online on [pgpkeygen.com](https://pgpkeygen.com). |
| `GPG_SIGNING_PASSPHRASE` | The passphrase for unlocking the secret key. (you picked it when creating the key).                                                                                                                                           |

Please define the secrets via your repository settings. ([Settings > Security > Secrets and variables > Actions](settings/secrets/actions))

## Release Process
### Creating a Release
To release a new version via the CI/CD Pipeline, please follow instructions below.
- Navigate to Actions (1)
- \> Main Pipeline (2)
- Click 'Run workflow' button (3)
- Select a semver release type with the 'Release Library' dropdown (4)
- 'Run the workflow' (5)
  ![image](https://github.com/thriving-dev/java-library-template/assets/10864443/8008fefd-efc3-466d-806f-5cc33eb74b7f)

The release process includes
- Pipeline run (incl. build & tests) that executes the release plugin (6)
- The release plugin first sets & commits the new version (7a)
- Creates & pushes a new tag (7b)
- Sets the main branch to the next SNAPSHOT version (7c)
  ![image](https://github.com/thriving-dev/java-library-template/assets/10864443/dd7694c7-36f2-497e-b768-f9a76516bacb)

The new version is automatically published to Maven Central! üöÄ
![image](https://github.com/thriving-dev/java-library-template/assets/10864443/89db0a69-c4ea-4f45-a655-8349d448a4c6)

### Prerequisites: PAT provided as `CI_GITHUB_TOKEN`
The CI/CD 'gradle-release' job expects a secret by the name `CI_GITHUB_TOKEN` that holds a PAT (Personal Access Token) with permission to push tags as part of the release process.

To create a new access token, please head over to the [Developer settings](/settings/tokens?type=beta) and enroll for the new 'Fine-grained personal access tokens'.
Next, click on the button 'Generate new token' and create a token for the target _Resource owner_, with access to your project and the following 'Repository Permissions'
* **Contents:** **Read** and **Write** access to code
* **Metadata:** **Read** access to metadata

Please refer to the official [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).

Provide your new PAT either as an Organisation secret or Repository secret.

## Javadoc
### Use
A Javadoc website of your library, generated by gradle, is 'published' to GitHub Pages by the CI/CD pipeline. In addition to each released version, the current snapshot version (_main_ branch) is published as `current`.    
-> visit the [live preview](https://thriving-dev.github.io/java-library-template/javadoc/).

<img width="680" alt="Preview of Javadoc published to GitHub Pages by the CI/CD pipeline" src="https://github.com/thriving-dev/java-library-template/assets/10864443/119e8055-2755-40d4-8ec4-69bdc2e5339b">

### Prerequisites: Configure GitHub Pages
To host the generated Javadoc, configure GitHub Pages for your repository to deploy from branch `gh-pages`. You can also find all deployments under ['pages-build-deployment'](https://github.com/%REPO_OWNER%/%REPO_NAME%/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment).

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The branch is created with the first CI/CD pipeline run. ('Publish javadoc' job)

## Security & CodeQL Analysis
### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
The libraries gradle dependencies are scanned for known [CVE](https://www.cve.org/) with **[aquasecurity/trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)**. The scan results can be reviewed and managed under [Security > Vulnerability alerts > Code scanning](https://github.com/%REPO_OWNER%/%REPO_NAME%/security/code-scanning).

Scans are triggered
1. with each main CI/CD pipeline run
2. Scheduled (weekly) ([ref](.github/workflows/2.scheduled.code-analysis.yml))
